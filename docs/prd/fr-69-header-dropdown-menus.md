## User Story

As a user, I want the header icons organized into dropdown menus for a cleaner interface.

## Problem

Header has multiple standalone icons that could be better organized into logical dropdown menus.

## Solution

### Gear Menu
- Config
- Mockups
- (future: API Help)

### Project Actions Menu
- Copy for calendar
- Copy full path
- Open in Finder

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Gear icon opens dropdown with Config and Mockups
- [ ] Project actions grouped into single dropdown
- [ ] Dropdowns close when clicking outside
- [ ] Keyboard accessible

## Technical Notes

Consider using a dropdown component library or building a simple one with proper accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).

## Completion Notes

_To be filled by developer._
