# Why overmind and not `npm run dev &`: overmind runs the processes under a tmux server that
# reparents to launchd, so nothing in the launching session's process group can take the app
# down with it. This is the shared app-lifecycle contract — same verbs in every AppyDave app.
#
# ⚠️ This is the AGENT-facing entry point. `scripts/start.sh` (where it exists) is the HUMAN one:
# it is interactive, it asks before reusing a busy port, and it runs in the foreground. Both are
# correct for their caller — do not merge them.
